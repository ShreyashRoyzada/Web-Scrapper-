# Week Work

Compiling the work I am doing every week for AI Champs.

###Week 1
I did basic python practice. Will add the code for the same soon.

###Week 2
Added a web scrapper that I made using BeautifulSoup. It collects the categories from a website called "http://books.toscrape.com/" and saves it in a .csv file
